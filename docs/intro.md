# ThreeTwo! 

`ThreeTwo!` is a comic book curation app. <br/><br/>

It aims to help you organize your comic book collection and automate various aspects of acquiring new comic books.<br/><br/> 

 It is a culmination of ideas I developed over the past couple of years using various pieces of software to achieve the stated goal of curating comic books. It borrows heavily from Mylar, Ubooquity, ComicRack, Calibre and many other software used to manage comic book collections.

## Philosophy

Curation is a disease of the mind, albeit a disease with a purpose. You want to be able to peruse your collection, and enjoy the process of doing so.

#### Discovery

The first tenet of `ThreeTwo!` is discoveryâ€“the act of importing comics from your OS, finding new comic to read or just searching through your collection for a comic that sparks nostalgia. Discovery is important, both from a technical perspective, so that `ThreeTwo!` can infer metadata from your collection, as well as from a curatorial standpoint, you want to keep track of what you are reading, or what you want to be reading.

#### Curation

`ThreeTwo!` takes curation seriously, and thusly offers ComicVine scraping, and other means of applying/extending the comic metadata. This is so that your collection can truly shine, and actually help in discovering or rediscovering comics.


#### Acquisition

Once you have added to your list of _wanted_ comics, you can rely on `ThreeTwo!`'s first-class support for `DC++` via `AirDC++` to acquire them. Just configure your `AirDC++` host, hub information and you are golden.


#### Consumption

You can access your massive comic collection via `OPDS` through apps on your mobile devices, like `Panels` on `iOS`
